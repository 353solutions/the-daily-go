# The Daily Go

Workshop given at [GopherCon EU 2019](https://www.gophercon.es/)

## Description

Writing code is hard, maintaining it is even harder. In this workshop we'll
cover the daily tasks a typical gopher goes through (aka "best practices"). 

We will write together an example project and cover the following subjects:

- Design decisions
- Code structure
- Managing dependencies
- Documentation
- Testing
- Debugging
- Logging & metrics
- Performance tuning
- Continuous integration
- Deployment strategies
- Development workflow & code reviews

There will be a lot of quotes, bad jokes and lines of code.
